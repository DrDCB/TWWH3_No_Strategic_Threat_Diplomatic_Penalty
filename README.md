# No Strategic Threat Diplomatic Penalty
A mod for Total War Warhammer III. The "Great Power" diplomatic penalty is back in WH3, now renamed to "Strategic Threat". This mod simply sets all scales of the penalty to zero.

Note that there is supposedly a diplomatic buff available from some AI factions for being a strategic threat, but I have never seen it myself. That has also been removed as well. Consider it a concession to balance.

My other diplomacy mod that you may be interested in - [No Diplomatic Penalty for "Too Many Trade Partners"](https://github.com/DrDCB/TWWH3_No_Diplomatic_Penalty_For_Too_Many_Trade_Partners).

Mod originally uploaded to the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790213699). Releases added here to support other platforms.
